# RandomWalk
Project Nmae: RandomWalkWithVisulization

Author: Jingwen Yu

Description:
A python scrip for paraview, Simulate the movement of mRNAs inside cell with different shapes of mitochondrial. Calculate the distance from mRNAs to mitochondiral and the distance that every time a mRNA moves, write the output to a txt file called "result.txt" in the same directory, at the meantime, generate a new window to visulize the simulation in 3D.
